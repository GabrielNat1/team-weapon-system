# Mini Frella for Roblox Game

This repository contains the code for a **mini frella system** used in a Roblox game. The system is responsible for distributing weapons to players based on their platform (mobile or PC).

## Description

This is a small system implemented as part of a larger Roblox game. It detects whether a player is on a mobile device or PC and provides them with the appropriate weapons based on their platform:

- **Mobile Players**: Receive a specific set of weapons suited for mobile gameplay.
- **PC Players**: Receive weapons based on their team, allowing for more complex weapon distribution based on team assignments.

## Features

- **Platform Detection**: Automatically detects whether the player is on mobile or PC.
- **Mobile Weapons**: Provides a predefined set of weapons for mobile players (e.g., AK47, Pistol, SMG, Shotgun).
- **Team-Based Weapons for PC**: Provides different weapons for players based on their team.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and integrate into your own Roblox game.
